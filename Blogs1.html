            <h1>What is it?</h1>
            <p> With healthier lifestyle , i would point towards the thought of having a ballance between everything
                like work,good habitsand daily deeds.The topic seems to be simple but still it seems many people in the
                corporate world are struggling in this aspect. This i am saying because i had a self observation
                regarding this.Also we may say progress at some time is a reflection of healthy lifestyle' </p>

            <h1>Struggles and genuine reasons</h1>
            <p>Some people have genuine reasons regarding not opting for good habits like rising early as there may be
                varying shifts work in the company they work.Some people have real struggle in building their career.The
                reasons
                may be genuine but not everlasting, so try your level best to lead a heathier life.In my view one or two
                habits may be wrong ,if you all the time being lazy won't perform heathier growth related tasks then
                your success may be hindered by this. </p>

        <div class="container  container-center">
            <h1> What to do?</h1>
            <p>In my views, if somebody has got his or her health affected or any ill effects he/she should slowly opt
                for good habits like rising early, eating fruitful,gyming,sports or any other task producing positive
                heath effects.You may not do these deeds all the time but you may definitely devote some time per your
                schedule. Adding a sport or gyming also may lead a fight with depression thereby, releasing good
                hormones. My
                suggestion for one who sit all the time and work is try a month with physical activites one hour atleast
                and you will feel the difference.At last i would conclude ,that progress is in direct proportion with
                heathy lifestyle.I wish the one reading this blog may lead a heathier life.
