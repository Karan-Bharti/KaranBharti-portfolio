            <h1>Two sides of a coin</h1>
            <p>As we know,every coin has two sides, the topic has two.In short, computers are boon as well as bane.Many
                industries have been arosed by computers and many have declined, that is why it is a contradictory
                topic.In my
                view this ocean like topic has many aspects which may not be covered in this blog but let's discuss a
                few of them
            </p>

    <section class="section">
        <div class="container container-center">
            <h1>Boon</h1>
            <p>Talking about the boon, computers are huge one. List of few are online shopping,online studies,easy
                communication to people sitting in different parts of world and many other such you may be familiar
                with.But i want to talk about industries like web app development,data science,business
                analytics,artificial intelligence,automation and many more which had provided mamoth of jobs thereby
                reducing unemployment.The online apps like news reading apps and social media had brought the whole
                world closer to us.Full entertainment industry has benefitted by development in the field of computers.
                In short it may be termed as a blessing afterknowing these boons.</p>

        <div class="container  container-center">
            <h1>Bane</h1>
            <p>Reading mamoth of benefits ,now why for some it seems to be a bane!!,let's talk about it
                briefly.Primarily bank frauds, replacement of human power,less knowledge and awareness about computers
                and many more are drawbacks.Online studies have come these days as an essential component of studies but
                due to non-availability or we
                must
                say lack of infrastructure, children have suffered.Hackers misusing information and blackmails in many
                aspects are also online commited crimes.Secondarily there adiction may be also a bane for some.At
                last i would recommend limited use of computers and right usage in right direction. I must say computers
                have pros as well as cons depending on one's situation</p>
